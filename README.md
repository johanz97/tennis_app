Tennis Court is an innovative app designed to streamline the management of tennis court bookings, allowing you to easily register, view, and delete your reservations. With Firebase integration, you can securely sign in, create, and maintain your account. Tennis Court uses a local JSON file for efficient data handling within the Flutter project and provides the ability to save and manage your favorite courts in local files. Additionally, the app helps you plan your games by checking the rain status of your favorite courts through the Weather API.
